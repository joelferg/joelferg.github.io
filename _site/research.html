      </summary>
      <p>Increasing the extent of irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa is a potential approach to closing yield gaps and improving resilience to climate change. Using over 3,000 satellite images spanning more than 30 years, we show that devel- opment of irrigation infrastructure in the Senegal River Valley has led to a large increase in average cultivation rates: a sixfold increase from 4 to 24 percentage points in the non-rainy season and a tripling from 10 to 30 percentage points cultivated in the rainy season. In spite of this substantial increase in cultivation rates, we find widespread heterogeneity across projects, with 1/4 of total irrigated area remaining unused as of 2019. We provide farmer survey evidence that limited access to water remains a major constraint on production and that removing this constraint requires action beyond individual farmers.

      </summary>
      <p>We study one of the central reforms in China’s economic miracle, the Household Responsibility System (HRS), which decollectivized agriculture starting in 1978. The HRS is commonly
        seen as having significantly boosted agricultural productivity—but this conclusion rests on
        unreliable official data. We use historical satellite imagery to generate new measurements of
        grain yield, independent of official Chinese statistics. Using two separate empirical designs
        that exploit the staggered rollout of the HRS across provinces and counties, we find no causal
        evidence that areas that adopted the HRS sooner experienced faster grain yield growth. These
        results challenge our conventional understanding of decollectivization, land reform, and the
        origins of the Chinese miracle.</p>

    <p><i>Abstract:</i> This study estimates the moderating impact of economic development on climate-conflict linkages during 1989–2019 in Africa, the world region that in recent decades has experienced the most armed conflict. We build a spatially disaggregated dataset that merges multiple decades of georeferenced data on climate shocks and conflict events with both local- and national-level measures of economic development to help shed light on the relative importance of local opportunity costs versus state capacity. We find that higher national GDP per capita greatly dampens the conflict risk associated with higher temperatures, suggesting that enhanced state capacity is a key factor.</p>

        <i>Abstract:</i> Open science practices such as posting data or code and pre-registering analyses are increasingly prescribed and debated in the applied sciences, but the actual popularity and lifetime usage of these practices remain unknown. This study provides an assessment of attitudes toward, use of, and perceived norms regarding open science practices from a sample of authors published in top-10 (most-cited) journals and PhD students in top-20 ranked North American departments from four major social science disciplines: economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. We observe largely favorable private attitudes toward widespread lifetime usage (meaning that a researcher has used a particular practice at least once) of open science practices. As of 2020, nearly 90% of scholars had ever used at least one such practice. Support for posting data or code online is higher (88% overall support and nearly at the ceiling in some fields) than support for pre-registration (58% overall). With respect to norms, there is evidence that the scholars in our sample appear to underestimate the use of open science practices in their field. We also document that the reported lifetime prevalence of open science practices increased from 49% in 2010 to 87% a decade later.

    Recent efforts have been very successful in accurately mapping welfare in data-sparse regions of the world using satellite imagery and other non-traditional data sources. However, the literature to date has focused on predicting a particular class of welfare measures, asset indices, which are relatively insensitive to short-term fluctuations in well-being. We suggest that predicting more volatile welfare measures, such as consumption expenditure, substantially benefits from the incorporation of data sources with high temporal resolution. By incorporating daily weather data into training and prediction, we improve consumption prediction accuracy significantly compared to models that only utilize satellite imagery

      <p>Applied economists have investigated individual adoption choices as wellas diffusion (aggregate adoption). The emphasis, however, has been on adopters’ behavior and risk associated with production and markets. Marketing also considersbroader aspects and marketers develop tools to address risk related to thefit of a product, its performance, and its reliability. This paper expands the economic literature onadoption by analyzing and assessing the implications of the choice of marketing tools,like money-back guarantees, demonstrations, and others, by marketers. The analysisis based on the threshold model of diffusion, which recognizes heterogeneity and dynamics. We provide evidence and examples from agriculture.</p>
