<h2> Bio </h2>
<p>
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.science/">Global Policy Lab</a> at University of California, Berkeley supervised by <a href="https://www.solomonhsiang.com/">Solomon Hsiang</a>. I earned a PhD in Agricultural & Resource Economics with a designated emphasis in Development Engineering in August, 2023 from Berkeley where I was an <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/infews/">Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems Fellow</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I study questions related to how agricultural systems around the world interact with the environment, often using remote sensing and machine learning tools which I sometimes help develop. My current projects include quantifying the environmental benefits of conservation agriculture adoption in Mexico, re-examining the effects of China's Household Responsibility System using historical satellite imagery, and exploring how agricultural productivity shocks due to weather fluctuations affect civil conflict likelihood in general equilibrium.
