<h2> Bio </h2>
<p>
I am a fifth year Agricultural & Resource Economics PhD candidate and an <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/infews/">Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems Fellow</a> at University of California, Berkeley. I study questions related to how agricultural systems around the world interact with the environment, often using remote sensing and machine learning tools which I sometimes help develop. My current projects include quantifying the environmental benefits of conservation agriculture adoption in Mexico, re-examining the effects of China's Household Responsibility System using historical satellite imagery, and exploring how agricultural productivity shocks due to weather fluctuations affect civil conflict likelihood in general equilibrium.
