<h2> Bio </h2>
<p>
I am a third year Agricultural & Resource Economics PhD student and an <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/infews/">Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems Fellow</a> at University of California, Berkeley. In my research, I apply recently developed econometric and machine learning techniques to questions in economic development, with a particular focus on sustainable development. My current projects involve quantifying the health benefits of reduced crop residue burning through sustainable agriculture in Mexico, assessing the long-run implications of different land tenure regimes on irrigation infrastructure management and rural development in Senegal, attempting to identify informal risk-sharing networks from panel consumption data, and understanding the effects of local market access on conflict in agriculture-dependent regions.

Before coming to Berkeley I was a Stanford Law Empirical Research Fellow working for <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/directory/daniel-p-kessler/">Daniel Kessler</a>, I worked as a research assistant for <a href="https://seankhiggins.com/">Sean Higgins</a>, and I earned a B.S. in Economics from Tulane University with minors in Mathematics and Portuguese.
