<h2> Bio </h2>
<p>
I am a fifth year Agricultural & Resource Economics PhD student and an <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/infews/">Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems Fellow</a> at University of California, Berkeley. My research is situated at the intersection of development economics and economic geography, with an emphasis on sustainable development. My current projects involve quantifying the health benefits of reduced crop residue burning due to sustainable agriculture adoption in Mexico, estimating income in China during the 1970s using historical satellite imagery, and understanding the effects of market integration on armed conflict in agriculture-dependent regions.

Before coming to Berkeley I was a Stanford Law Empirical Research Fellow working for <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/directory/daniel-p-kessler/">Daniel Kessler</a>, I worked as a research assistant for <a href="https://seankhiggins.com/">Sean Higgins</a>, and I earned a B.S. in Economics from Tulane University with minors in Mathematics and Portuguese.
