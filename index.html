Hello! I'm a rising third year Agricultural & Resource Economics PhD student at University of California, Berkeley. In my research, I apply recently developed econometric and machine learning techniques to questions in economic development, with a particular focus on sustainable development. My current projects involve quantifying the health benefits of reduced crop residue burning through conservation agriculture in Mexico, assessing the long-run implications of different land tenure regimes on irrigation infrastructure management and rural development in Senegal, attempting to identify informal risk-sharing networks from panel consumption data, and disentangling the effects of climate and agricultural productivity on the onset of conflict in sub-Saharan Africa.
