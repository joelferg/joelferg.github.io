<h2> Bio </h2>
<p>
I am a fifth year Agricultural & Resource Economics PhD candidate and an <a href="https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/infews/">Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems Fellow</a> at University of California, Berkeley. I develop and use remote sensing and machine learning tools to study questions in global agriculture. My current projects include quantifying the health benefits of conservation agriculture adoption in Mexico due to reduced residue burning, re-examining the effects of China's Household Responsibility System using historical satellite imagery, and exploring how agricultural productivity shocks due to weather affect civil conflict lieklihood in general equilibrium.
